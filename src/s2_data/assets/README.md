# Spelunky Asset Extractor / Repacker

## Credits
The vast majority of the work behind extracting these assets comes
from the work of SciresM.

Additionally a lot of clean up and expansion of that work came from
Cloppershy

Both of these contributions were crucial to this library.

Cloppershy was also instrumental in providing the original implementation for
repacking, as seen here:

Lastly, `iojonmbnmb#8149 ` provided the updated hashing code when
it was changed in 1.13.0

Cloppershy discovered alignment issue that prevented audio from working.
